Revision history for B-Lint-Pluggable

0.01_01  2006-02-16
         Just uploading my ~/src/B-Lint-Pluggable to CPAN, polish to come later.

0.02 2007-03-18
     Just require the latest B::Lint. Argh. This module is too much of a pain to live.

1.00 sometime in the past
     Scooped the guts out.

2.00 2007-12-21
     Fixed for tests and such. It's still empty. Go use B::Lint for real instead.
